# The Front End of Portfolio Website 
- It is the front end of my portfolio website. My portfolio website is a simple website that shows simple greetings, recent projects, and personal contact. This front end is built using Vue Framework and Bulma for styling. You can see the result at https://hammamislami.herokuapp.com/.
- It is just the front end, to get data, you must run the API. 
The API for this front end is available at https://github.com/glayOne23/the-api-of-porfolio-website
